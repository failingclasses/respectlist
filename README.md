I respect some of these people more than others

 * C0an - Good guy, bullies me a lot, but ok in general. DOGSHIT at valorant though.
 * F̶e̶s̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶-̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶o̶n̶'̶t̶
 * Curtis - Had some beef with him about me fucking around with a pearling system, is chill in general.
 * Bomp - Just cause he works for rival doesn't make him a dogshit dev, his pearls are a little glitchy.
 * Vaz - 3'9" and has 7 strains of herpes. Just kidding, love the guy, gets on my nerves sometimes, good AC dev. Would love to get his head under my panini press.
 Will get perma-banned on MMC if he holds his ulti one more time in a game of ranked. The man could be high diamond in Overwatch but feeds his balls off.
 * Badger - Can pack, have respect. Tried to swat me but got the wrong state.
 * E1bito - Good dev, has a good rep. I feel bad for what Predz did to him though.
 * My Mom - Raised me, is very good mother.
 * Oyuh - Knows javascript, I owe him my life. Very cute habibi ooloolooloolooloololloolloollooloolloollool
